# Extension Disabler
Minimalistic extension for toggling all extensions on / off.

## What is it for?
My tinfoil hat was getting tighter after hearing some popular browser extensions were being sold to unknown parties.  
I got into the habit of disabling all my extensions while I did more sensitive browsing like banking, but with many extensions installed it was a bit of a hassle.  
So I created a simple toggle button that could disable / enable all of my currently enabled extensions.

Of course it's just another extension, so I though if I share it I should at least make it open source so people can inspect the code and install it manually for peace of mind.

## How to install
1. Clone the repository with git or download it as a zip and extract the files.
2. Go to "chrome://extensions" in your URL bar.
3. Enable "Developer mode" from the top right corner.
4. Select "Load unpacked" from the top.
5. Select the root of the extension folder. 

Alternatively you can install it from the chrome webstore, but that kind of defeats the point of open source security.

## How to use
Simply click the round Green/Red toggle button at the top of your browser window to toggle all current extensions on/off.  
Green = extensions enabled  
Red = extensions disabled


**Notice:** some browsers might not show the extension icons by default, so you might have to pin the extension first from the extensions menu in the right edge.
